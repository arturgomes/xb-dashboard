# What's new?

Now we have a kanban-style dashboard with the shipments arriving in 
the next seven days.

For each day, a list of cards, each one representing a shipment, is displayed.

In each card, a chip from Material-UI, displays the status of the shipment, 
with different color depending on the kind of status.
